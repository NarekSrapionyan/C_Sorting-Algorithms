Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to this Sorting Algorithms in C repository! ðŸš€

Here, you'll find various sorting algorithms implemented in C, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, and more. These implementations cover both arrays and linked lists, helping you understand different sorting techniques.

If you're looking to practice sorting algorithms, feel free to explore the code, run the programs, or even modify them to experiment! ðŸ› 

ðŸ’¡ Want to contribute?
You're welcome to suggest improvements, report issues, or submit pull requests. Whether you want to optimize an algorithm, add a new sorting method, or improve code readabilityâ€”every contribution is appreciated!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
